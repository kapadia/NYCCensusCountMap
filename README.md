# Census Count Map

The NY Census Count Map brings together data from a number of sources into a single tool to help organizations and individuals count everyone in New York. The application is currently in active development and is temporarily deployed at this link: [ https://stuartlynn.github.io/NYCCensusCountMap ](https://stuartlynn.github.io/NYCCensusCountMap/)

## Running the app

The app has been built as a stand alone single page React app. To spin the app up locally for development follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stuartlynn/NYCCensusCountMap.git
```

2. Move in to the repo folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd NYCCensusCountMap
yarn
```

or if you like npm better you can do

```bash
cd NYCCensusCountMap
npm i
```

then run the application

```bash
yarn start
```

or

```bash
npm start
```

this should open up a browser window running the app on port 3000. If you navigate to http://localhost:3000 you should see the app running.

## Contributing to the project
